            I have been taking and ripping apart various pictures throughout the years, and piled them all on <a
                href="http://vvvoiddd.tumblr.com/">vvvoiddd.party</a>

            I have been working on an absurd debate game, based on Schopenhauer's <a
                href="http://coolhaus.de/art-of-controversy/">The Art of Being Right: 38 Ways to Win an Argument</a>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="small">
        <img src="/assets/miscellaneous/arguments.gif"/>
        <p>
            I piled his arguments into different 'action' cards, which are to be used in combination to a given topic to
            debate over.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="small">
        <img src="/assets/miscellaneous/back.png"/>
        <p>
            As these arguments are rather difficult to pull off or properly dishonest, I decided to make the game as
            ridiculous and meaningless as possible.

    <li class="small">
        <img src="/assets/miscellaneous/personalities.gif"/>
        <p>
            Therefore, each time two debaters pick a topic to debate over, they also are obliged to pick 'personalities'
            cards to combine with the type of arguments they will use.

        <p>
            I explored the 100 most popular topics of debate in recent history, and branded each with a 'value' factor
            -- the trickiest this theme is to debate, the more rewarding it will be to win it over.

<h1>GIRI</h1>

        <p>
            GIRI was a charity-based digital project, led by Pierre Vanliefland and I. We wanted to build a smart, easy to use platform where users can find and join charity events locally and spontaneously.
        </p>
        <p>After several months of work, we decided to put the project aside until further investment.</p>

        <p>
            Wireframes of GIRI web-platform, where you can visualise every charity event happening around you, listed by amount of people needed. For each event, you can offer specific skills that you own; it can be either physical or digital work, or driving and cooking for instance.
