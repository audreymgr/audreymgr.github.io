            Bompas & Parr asked me to bring to life a legendary punchbowl dreamt by Johannes Kepler to illustrate
            movements of the planets towards each other. Through this, he was meant to demonstrate the existence of the
            Solar System.
        </p>
        <p>This punchbowl had to be as extraordinary as possible; we therefore decided to combine Kepler's and Chladni's
            experiments, by making the entire structure vibrate through the frequencies of sub-bass. Fluids follow the
            vibrations of music to create eerie patterns inside the punchbowl.</p>

            Alcoholic Architecture is a bar where monks meet Miami, ghosts speak in loos, and snakes destroy castles.
            But beyond all, Alcoholic Architecture is a bar where you do not drink alcohol... you breathe it. It's the
            world's first breathable cloud of cocktail, previously based in Broadway Market, London.
