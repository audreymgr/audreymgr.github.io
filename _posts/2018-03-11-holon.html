                PARSEC is an augmented-reality app-based video game, directly targetting wannabe hackers. I am responsible for the imagining and writing of the narrative and game flow. I also conceived the UI design and am currently building our website. We aim to show a functional prototype of PARSEC at the end of Summer 2017.
