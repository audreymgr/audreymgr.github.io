        <p>
            Route1 is a tech start-up disrupting the legal recruitment industry. I joined as the first employee and was a key contributor as the company grew to a valuation of Â£2m through 3 rounds of funding, 15 employees, and 9,000 active users.</p>
        <p>I was responsible for building the brand from the ground up, managing the entire process from conception through to execution. Working closely with the tech team, I led the design of the two primary products of the business: a native mobile app and web platform. I also worked alongside the marketing team to create adverts for a wide range of digital, social and physical marketing campaigns.</p>

            I single-handedly took care of the UX and UI design of Route1 candidates app. This app is a hyper-targeted,
            hyper-curated jobs boards for lawyers in the UK and Australia.

            Route1's second digital product is a webtool for legal employers. The aim of this hub is to make the
            experience of hiring lawyers through our app completely friction-free and simple. I took care of
            re-designing the entirety of both the UX and the UI of the hub, in order to make it as minimal and modern as
            possible.
        </p>
        <p>The Hub 2.0 is currently under production.</p>
