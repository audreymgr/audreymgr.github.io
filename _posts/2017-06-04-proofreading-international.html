            Proofreading International is a multi national company offering proofreading services. I was hired to lead on the wholesale rebranding of the business, which included their 5 sister-companies. In addition to the brand work, each platform needed its own web and digital marketing designs. I was also responsible for the conception of their education tool, which will be live shortly.
