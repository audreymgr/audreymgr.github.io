            <a href="https://jack.media/">Jack</a> is a Belgian slow-messaging app, which offers a romantic alternative to digital relationships. I looked into innovative and artistic concepts to help them create a beautiful user experience. After research and ideation, I designed a selection of propositions which led to a big re-design of the product and concept itself.
        </p>
        <p>You can download Jack on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/you-have-a-jack/id1019167559?ls=1&mt=8">App Store</a> and on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jack45.jack">Google Play</a>.</p>

        <p>
            My first research proposal was to generate colour gradients following the date on which a specific Jack would be available to be read.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="small">
        <img src="/assets/jack/gr2.gif"/>
        <p>
            Each gradient moves clockwise, until it stops to show it's finally available to be read. After waiting for a while, you can finally discover what your friend has been wanting to tell you for a while.

        <p>
            Example of the grid principle I designed concerning the proposal of gradient messages, taking the entirety
            of the screen each time.

        <p>
            My second proposal was to use a 3-dimensional space for Jacks: what if you could see a Jack moving towards you as it comes closer to its opening date.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="small">
        <img src="/assets/jack/planets2.gif"/>
        <p>
            The timeline follows the closest and farthest Jacks on the screen: here, you can see that Rachel's Jack will only be available in 2115.
