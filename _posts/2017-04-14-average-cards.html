            Average Cards is a greeting cards company, whose goal is to offer factual cards for the tired reader. Are
            you sick of endless, meaningless glittery and insincere greetings? Average Cards is here for you. Launching
            it online last April with Pierre Vanliefland, we're now looking at taking it to the shops.

            There are some tasks that simply need a helping hand, and there are some that involve a shovel and 12
            gallons of gasoline. It’s time to show a bit of gratitude!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Best for:</strong> your friend that helped you dispose of those "yard trimmings" last week
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Inappropriate:</strong> only if fallen into the wrong hands?
        </p>

        <img src="/assets/averagecards/verywell.jpg"/>
        <p>
            You just met this person and you’re pathetically trying to become their friend.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Best for:</strong> people that won’t freak out when they realise you’ve been stalking their Facebook
            profile
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Inappropriate:</strong> your significant other
        </p>
    </li>

        <p>
            Recognising it might be the first step towards a long and unexciting reconciliation process.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Best for:</strong> someone that you don't talk to anymore
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Inappropriate:</strong> if that someone has filed a restraining order
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="small">
        <img src="/assets/averagecards/sucks.jpg"/>
        <p>
            Something sucks, and it needs to be said.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Best for:</strong> people facing stuff that sucks and coulrophobics
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Inappropriate:</strong> nah - it had to be said.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="small">
        <img src="/assets/averagecards/holiday.jpg"/>
        <p>
            You are on holiday and you feel that the world should now. Or maybe you aren't on holiday but want to trick
            others into thinking you are? Who cares?
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Best for:</strong> anyone that is not on holiday
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Inappropriate:</strong> when you are in prison or on sick leave
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="small">
        <img src="/assets/averagecards/hospital.jpg"/>
        <p>
            A friend, or even better, an enemy, is at the hospital. There’s nothing you can say to make things better,
            so don’t.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Best for:</strong> people that have a decent chance to get out of there alive
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Inappropriate:</strong> nurses or doctors - it's just not funny
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
