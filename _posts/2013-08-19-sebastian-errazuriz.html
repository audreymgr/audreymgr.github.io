            'Tough Love unloads a series of objects, from clothing to paintings, and traces social burdens that each of us carry. The exhibition reminds us that justice and evil are not things that are witnessed but exercised by acts of difference and indifference. Tough Love reminds us that too often we limit ourselves to just being humans, forgetting the responsibility we have to act as citizens, and conversely, that as citizens of narrow ideological lands, we often forget our humanity.'

            Each artwork was thought and designed to make the viewer look again. We dedicated each piece to a specific social issue in America, which has to be talked about.

            'Originally designed as foldable chairs/signs for the protesters of Occupy Wall Street, “Occupy Chairs” provide the users a sign to protest during the day and a fold out chair to gather together next to their tents at night.'

            'According to statistics one in five women on a given college campus will be raped; 85 percent of those women will know their attackers; and 90 percent of those rapes will go unreported. The male student athletes accused of rape often receive support from the schools while the girls tend to suffer public shame until silenced.'

            Wanting to get a contract with the famous plastic shoe company <a href="https://shopmelissa.uk/">Melissa</a>, Sebastian Errazuriz decided to create a dozen of shoe sculptures, based on 12 of his ex lovers' personalities. He shared with me 12 short stories and asked me to help him and his team imagine 12 shoes to fit these stories.
The shoes can be seen everywhere on internet and in fashion international magazines.
