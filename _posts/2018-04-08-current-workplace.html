            DT is an automotive social media website featuring The Grand Tour presenters.</p>
        <p>The website launched in November 2016 with several selected tribe leaders to get things started. These early adopters started their tribes a week ahead of the full release to allow new fan made tribes to reach maturity before the masses are allowed entry. Each tribe has a specific theme and members join whichever tribe fits their personal tastes. The trio were joined by several automotive celebrities such as Mark Webber, Damon Hill, and many others.</p>

            I recreated lots of pop-culture brands and logos with our name, in order to print car stickers.

            I designed several illustrations, including the iconic Toyota AE89 in Initial D.

             UT is a web-based mobile game I imagined and conceived over the course of 3 weeks only. The goal was to check whether our user base would be interested in a mini-game, competing against each other. UT is currently under further development, along with an F1-oriented skin (see below).

            The end screen of the game, for the poor ones who lost against May.

        <p>
            This is the F1 skin I designed for the next version of UT. I used the iconic Monaco tunnel and a classic â€™30 poster atmosphere for this.
