            DriveTribe is an automotive social media website created by Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond.</p>
        <p>The website and mobile app launched in November 2016, with several selected tribe leaders to get things started. These early adopters started their tribes a week ahead of the full release to allow new fan-made tribes to reach maturity before the masses are allowed entry. Each tribe has a specific theme and members join whichever tribe fits their personal tastes. The trio were joined by several automotive celebrities such as Mark Webber, Damon Hill, and many others.</p>

            DriveTribe currently holds over 1 million registered users, and a whopping 3 billion impressions per month. It has an excellent rating on both Google Play and the App Store.</p>

            The average session length on Joyride is, and has been since launch in May, over 7 minutes long. The pool of users is still quite small, around 8,000 weekly users. But the stickiness of Joyride is undeniable; especially compared to DriveTribe. I am very proud that I played a big part in conceiving and shipping this app.</p>

             Upshift Thunder is a web-based mobile game I imagined and conceived over the course of 3 weeks only. The goal was to check whether our user base would be interested in a mini-game, competing against each other. UT is currently under further development, along with an F1-oriented skin (see below).

            This is the F1 skin I designed for the next version of Upshift Thunder. I used the iconic Monaco tunnel and a classic â€™30 poster atmosphere for this.
