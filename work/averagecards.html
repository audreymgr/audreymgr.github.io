                    There are some tasks that simply need a helping hand, and there are some that involve a shovel and 12 gallons of gasoline. It’s time to show a bit of gratitude!
                    <br/><strong>Best for:</strong> your friend that helped you dispose of those "yard trimmings" last week
                    <br/><strong>Inappropriate:</strong> only if fallen into the wrong hands?

                    You just met this person and you’re pathetically trying to become their friend.
                    <br/><strong>Best for:</strong> people that won’t freak out when they realise you’ve been stalking their Facebook profile
                    <br/><strong>Inappropriate:</strong> your significant other
                </p>
